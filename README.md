The task was to prepare data from PDF files, which we had to scrape from portals provided by the organizers.

The main goals were to create 5 csv tables containing:
- meta data information about the pdf
- bag of words (non-standardized)
- bag of words (normalized - stemming, lemmatization)
- checking if the pdf has the given expressions
- extraction of most important data
